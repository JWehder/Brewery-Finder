# Phase-1 Project: Brewery Finder

Brewery Finder is a web application that displays information about breweries: name, phone number, address, and website, if available. You can search for breweries using the search bar and save their information in your saved breweries list.

## Installation

Download the files given in the repository to a destination of your choice.

Open up your terminal and navigate to the file utilizing your command line. If you do not know how to navigate the terminal using the command line then check out an article I wrote regarding this topic (here).

Once you have arrived at the project's directory, run:

```bash
code .
```

All of the data for your saved breweries will be stored in the db.json file. You will need to run the command below in your terminal to start the server and get the saved breweries functionality working.

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```

## Usage

You can either check out the randommized collection of breweries posted to the homepage or search for a brewery yourself using the search bar in the top left corner.

## Roadmap 

-I would like to add a delete button to each of the saved brewery cards.
-I would like to add a home button to redirect you back to the home page
