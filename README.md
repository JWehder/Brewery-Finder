# Phase-1 Project: Brewery Finder

Brewery Finder is a web application that displays information about breweries: name, phone number, address, and website, if available. You can search for breweries using the search bar and save their information in your saved breweries list.

## Installation

Download the files given in the repository to a destination of your choice.

Open up your terminal and navigate to the file utilizing your command line. If you do not know how to navigate the terminal using the command line then check out an article I wrote regarding this topic (here)

All of the data for your saved breweries will be stored in the db.json file. You will need to run json-server --watch db.json in your terminal to start the server and get the saved breweries functionality working.

```bash
json-server --watch db.json
```
